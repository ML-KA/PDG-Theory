# theoretical ML Paper Discussion Group (theory-PDG)

We meet weekly to discuss theoretical machine learning related papers and methods.
The setup is whiteboard session and small group style.
The most important rule: If we cannot derive the thoughts in the paper on the board ourselves, we do no understand them.
