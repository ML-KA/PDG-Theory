# theoretical ML Paper Discussion Group (theory-PDG)

We meet weekly to discuss theoretical machine learning related papers and methods.
The setup is whiteboard session and small group style.
The most important rule: If we cannot derive the thoughts in the paper on the board ourselves, we do not understand them.


# Future of Theory-PDG (09. October 2018 until X)

* Bayesian NN
* Statistical Learning Theory

# Reading History

* Finished 02. October 2018 - Fisher-Rao Metric, Geometry, and Complexity of Neural Networks
